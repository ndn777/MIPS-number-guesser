# MIPS-number-guesser
This is a simple MIPS program that tries to guess a number you choose between 1 and 32. 

I used the MARS MIPS simulator to run this program.

Open ‘NumberReader.asm’ in a MIPS IDE.

Assemble and run the program.

Think of a number between 1 to 32, then review the 16 numbers displayed in the I/O console.

The program asks the question “Is your card showing?” and then waits for your input so that it can guess your number. If your number is present in the display of numbers, enter ‘1’. If your number is not showing, enter ‘0’. If you do not enter ‘1’ or ‘0’, the program prompts you for input again.

A new set of numbers will be displayed and you will once again be prompted if your card is showing. 

Repeat the last two steps until there is only one number. 

To play the game again, enter ‘1’. To exit the game, enter ‘0’.
